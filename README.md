# Personal Filter Lists

My personal filter lists for uBlock Origin (and AdGuard Home). Cosmetic list is designed to make websites usably minimalist, and tracker list is designed to increase privacy. 

## What's Included

**General Tracker Filterlist Rules:** Tracker blocking, analytics, fingerprinting scripts, Telemetry, URL parameters, and Canadian-specific tracking domains not covered by default lists.

**Cosmetic Filterlist Rules:** Cookie banners, newsletter popups, anti-adblock nags, social media widgets, and other annoyances. (very strict)

## Should You Use These?

**Probably not as direct imports.** These lists are:
- Tailored to my browsing habits and websites I visit
- Include some Canadian-specific entries
- Extremely opinionated about what counts as "annoyances"

**Better approach:** Use as inspiration to build your own lists, or test them and remove rules that break sites you care about. Don't blindly import filter lists, understand what you're blocking.

## Maintenance

- Updated irregularly as I encounter new tracking/annoyances
- Tested with uBlock Origin on LibreWolf 143+
- Tracker list designed for the advanced capabilities of uBlock Origin, but 70% of filters should work with an inteligent network-level blocker, like AdGuard Home.
