# personal filter lists
these are my personal ublock origin filter lists, also ubo backup and violentmonkey scripts backup.
Make sure to restore violentmonkey scripts twice, sometimes the restore from zip doesn't work too great.

My ubo backup and violentmonkey back-ups will only work on their respective beta releases (I think, you're welcome to try), not the stable release.

You can find ubo beta here:

and violentmonkey beta here:
https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/releases
